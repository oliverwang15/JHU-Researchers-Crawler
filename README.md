## JHU-Researchers-Crawler


### 1. How to Use ?
* Run in code in the [notebook](./main.ipynb)

* Or run the `main.py` file directly:
  ``` shell
  python main.py
  ```

### 2. Which school/department can I crawl?

* Now the the CS and AMS department of Whiting School of Engineering is tested. Theoretically, all the departments of Whiting should be supported.

* However, other schools are not supported now. You can create issues if you need more schools.
